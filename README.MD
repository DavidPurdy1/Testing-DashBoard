# TODO
- Formatting the table with Image Paths.

- Add search for tester and test status

- Fix increment of the table so it doesn't go up by 2 right now if something isn't even then it will mess up

- Fix Button Formatting

- Fix the test launcher so it will enable the buttons and tell you when it is finished instead of an estimate

- Fix the command line launcher so you don't have to download visual studio and run it that way. 

- Fix testing status for interrupted as well as pass and fail, check in cleanup for if a window of intact is open
